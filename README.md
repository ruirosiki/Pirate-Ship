# Getting Started

The player's and computer's ships are randomly placed at the beginning of the game. The player will start first and alternate turns with the computer. The player will choose a coordinate to attack by clicking a square on the computers grid. The game will let the player know if the attack was a miss or a hit. After the players turn, the computer will then take a turn. Play will alternate back and forth until a winner is determined by either the player or the computer having hit all ships. Once the game has ended, the player will be given the opportunity to reset the game and play it again.
